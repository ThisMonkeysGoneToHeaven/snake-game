v1 - A quick prototype to get going
v2 - proper classes and shit, how it's really meant to be done

Things to add:

-> pause
-> levels - only speed initially but eventually maybe walls as well
-> scorecard

Bugs:
-> still able to reproduce scenarios where self-collision remains undtected, especially when snake comes from across the
other end of the surface
-> food still spawns over the snake at times

Issues:
-> snake head and food alignment feels off
-> laggy???
